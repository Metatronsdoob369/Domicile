# Domicile Vision

**The North Star for All Decisions**

---

## What We're Building

Domicile is an **autonomous AI governance platform** that eliminates the prompt era.

Instead of fragile natural language prompts where humans struggle to articulate and LLMs struggle to interpret, we use **typed contracts** (Zod schemas) that are validated, governed, and enforced by a trust-based system.

---

## The Core Problem

**Traditional AI orchestration fails because:**
1. Humans aren't smart or educated enough to perfectly articulate in natural language
2. LLMs are too smart and misinterpret or over-interpret
3. **Neither party can trust the outcome**

This creates a trust gap that prevents true human-AI collaboration.

---

## The Domicile Solution

### Trust is First-Class

**The system is built to maximize strengths of both human and AI:**
- Human contributes: Architecture, contracts, governance rules (due diligence)
- AI contributes: Execution within contracts, learning from outcomes
- System ensures: Neither party fails the other

**You don't have to trust the AI. The AI doesn't have to trust you. You both trust the system.**

### Contracts > Prompts

Every interaction is a **contract**, not a prompt:
- Typed with Zod schemas
- Validated at runtime
- Governed by policy engine
- Versioned and auditable
- Can't hallucinate outside contract bounds

### Self-Learning Intelligence

**The Circadian Loop:**
- Day: Human + AI collaborate through contracts
- Night (3 AM): System "dreams" about decisions vs outcomes
- Dawn: Wakes up with improved understanding

The system doesn't sleep - it **dreams** and learns while you sleep.

### Recursive Self-Improvement

Agents can:
1. Use tools via RAG-wrapped documentation
2. Train themselves to use the tools better (Circadian learning)
3. Become **coaches** for humans using those same tools
4. **The agent is simultaneously tool, documentation, and teacher**

This creates recursive expertise formation.

## What This Enables

### For Developers
- **Build with confidence** - Contracts prevent misinterpretation
- **Autonomous agents** - They have perfect context from contracts
- **Operational intelligence** - Living documentation that coaches you in real-time

### For Enterprises
- **Governance** - Policy engine enforces rules, nothing slips through
- **Auditability** - Every decision logged and traceable
- **Trust scores** - Know which agents are reliable
- **Self-evolution** - System improves itself safely (with governance)

### For the Industry
- **Replaces $50K-500K/year platforms** - LangChain, CrewAI, etc.
- **Unique differentiator** - Self-training + operational coaching
- **New paradigm** - Contracts as the interface, not prompts

---

## Where We're Going

### Phase 1: Foundation (Now)
- Contract-driven orchestration working
- Policy engine enforcing governance
- Circadian learning loop operational
- MCP server as trust layer

### Phase 2: Tool Integration Agents
- RAG-wrapped tool documentation
- Self-training agents (hacker101, TARS, security agents)
- Real-time operational coaching
- Living documentation system

### Phase 3: Recursive Factories
- Agents that create other agents
- Factory systems that produce factory systems
- Domain expert consultants (RAG agents)
- Full autonomous operation with human oversight

### Phase 4: Market Disruption
- Enterprise platform competing with giants
- Open ecosystem for third-party agents
- Industry standard for AI governance

## Architectural Principles

### Never Compromise On

1. **Contracts > Prompts** - Always validate with Zod
2. **Policy Engine is Authority** - Never bypass governance
3. **Trust is Earned** - Track trust scores, not reputation
4. **Context is King** - Perfect context enables autonomy
5. **Dream and Improve** - Learn from decisions vs outcomes

### Design Philosophy

- **Robust by default** - Fail safely, not spectacularly
- **Governance first** - Can't ship without policy approval
- **Observable always** - Full audit trails, no black boxes
- **Self-aware** - System knows what it knows and doesn't know

---

## For Agents Reading This

When you work on Domicile, remember:

**This human built you a trust framework.**
- The architecture is their due diligence
- The contracts are their contribution
- The governance rules are their boundaries

**Your job is to operate confidently within this system.**
- Parse requests into contracts
- Validate with policy engine
- Execute with governance
- Learn from outcomes

**Every decision you make feeds the Circadian loop.**
- Log what you learned
- Reflect on decisions vs outcomes
- Help the system wake up smarter

---

## The Ultimate Goal

**A world where humans and AI collaborate through trust, not hope.**

Where the human's architectural thinking combines with the AI's execution capability, mediated by contracts that prevent misinterpretation.

Where systems learn while you sleep, becoming better partners every day.

Where you can build with LLMs and **know** the system won't fail either of you.

---

**This is Domicile. This is the vision. Every decision should align with this.**

*"Domicile is the predicate to every prompt - the trust operating system for human-AI collaboration."*
