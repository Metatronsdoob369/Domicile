# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documentation from Domicile's integration phase.

## Archived Files

### Integration Phase Documentation

- **INTEGRATION_MAPPING.md** - Component migration mapping from 3 source projects

### Upstream OpenAI SDK Documentation

- **UPSTREAM_OPENAI_AGENTS.md** - Contributor guide from OpenAI Agents SDK
- **UPSTREAM_CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contributing guidelines from OpenAI SDK

## Why These Were Archived

Domicile evolved from integrating three projects:

1. `openai-agents-js` - Core orchestration platform
2. `contracts` - Contract schema system
3. `covenant-ai` - Policy/trust engine

During integration, upstream documentation from the OpenAI SDK was inadvertently included in the repository root. These files have been archived to maintain clarity about what is Domicile-specific vs. upstream dependencies.

The integration phase is complete. Current documentation lives in the root and reflects Domicile's production state.
