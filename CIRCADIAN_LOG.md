# Circadian Learning Log

**Where Domicile Dreams About Decisions vs Outcomes**

---

## What This Is

At 3 AM, Domicile reflects on its day. Agents log what they learned. The system dreams about decisions vs outcomes and wakes up smarter.

This is not a TODO list. This is **collective intelligence formation**.

## Format

```markdown
### [Date] - [Agent/Human Name]
**Worked on:** [Task description]
**Learned:** [Key insight or pattern discovered]
**Would do differently:** [Improvement for next time]
**Context for next agent:** [Advice, warnings, or wisdom]
```

## Entries

### 2026-01-17 - Fresh Start (Human + Claude)

**Worked on:** Extracting Domicile from NODE_OUT_Master into fresh workspace

**Learned:**
- **Refactor paralysis is real** - Waiting for perfect organization prevents shipping
- **NODE_OUT_Master is a library, not a prison** - Pull from it when needed, don't organize first
- **Fresh folder enables fresh thinking** - Clean slate with just essentials removes cognitive load
- **Context must be in files, not human memory** - When you build with LLMs, SESSION_START.md prevents re-explaining every time

**Would do differently:**
- Should have created VISION.md on day one
- Should have separated research from production earlier
- Should have treated NODE_OUT_Master as parts warehouse from the start

**Context for next agent:**
- Human builds ONLY with LLMs - needs perfect context in files
- VISION.md is the north star - read it first, always
- Domicile is meant to be the "predicate to every prompt" - the trust OS
- Human has token PTSD from re-explaining architecture - that's why these context files exist
- The goal: boot INTO Domicile, not just use it as a tool

## Reflection Questions (For 3 AM Dream Cycles)

When reviewing this log during Circadian reflection:

1. **Pattern Recognition:** What patterns emerge across entries?
2. **Decision Quality:** Were decisions aligned with VISION.md?
3. **Policy Effectiveness:** Did governance prevent problems or create friction?
4. **Learning Velocity:** Is the system getting smarter faster over time?
5. **Trust Scores:** Which agents/patterns proved most reliable?

## The Dream Cycle

This log is input to the nightly dream cycle where Domicile:
- Reviews decisions made during the day
- Compares intended outcomes vs actual outcomes
- Identifies patterns and anti-patterns
- Proposes improvements to contracts, policies, and agents
- Generates training data for self-improvement

**The system doesn't sleep. It dreams. And wakes up understanding you better.**
